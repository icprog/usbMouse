This code is the result of a Tech-Talk posting from Miroslav Mihaylov at
the University of Chicago who wanted to add a simple hardware switch to
an EPICS soft IOC.  I suggested using a USB mouse with the switch wired
across one of the buttons.

The code is very preliminary.  I'd be happy to hear suggestions from someone with USB/HID expertise.

As the Wikipedia page on HID says:
    The USB HID API is complicated and can be difficult to
    understand. Despite the complexity, developers who wish
    to do basic things with the API need only learn a small
    portion of it. The primary challenge in learning the API
    lies in determining which parts one needs to use.
