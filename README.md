usbMouse 0.3.1 based on usbMouse 0.3
=================

Since I cannot compile the downloaded usbMouse 0.3 from

https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/modules/index.php

I would like to re-arrange sources in order to compile and
to execute an IOC.

Please look at [the original README](README) also.
